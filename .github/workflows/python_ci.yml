name: Python CI Pipeline

# 1. TRIGGER: Run on every push or pull request to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# 2. JOBS: Define one job
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    name: Build, Install, and Test
    # Specify the runner environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # 3. STEPS: Define the sequence of tasks
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository Code
      # Downloads the code onto the runner
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python
      # Installs Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.11' # Specify the desired Python version
        # Recommended: Cache pip dependencies for faster subsequent runs
        cache: 'pip' 
        
    - name: Install Dependencies
      # Install project dependencies, including 'pytest' and 'flake8' 
      # (If they are in requirements.txt or equivalent)
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
    - name: Install Pytest and Flake8 (If not in requirements.txt)
      # Best practice: If not using a requirements file, install test/lint tools here.
      # We are installing flake8 here to ensure it is available for the next step.
      run: pip install pytest flake8 

    - name: Lint with Flake8
      # Run the code quality check using the installed flake8 tool.
      # The '--exit-zero' flag is useful if you want the step to pass 
      # even with warnings, but it's usually removed in CI to force failure on errors.
      # We removed the 'pip install flake8' line from this step.
      run: |
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics

    - name: Run Pytest
      # Execute the tests after dependencies and linting have passed.
      run: pytest
